I'm Davor, a software developer. I make things for the web most days. Sometimes I do system programming too. I wrote Lisp and Haskell for years. Not much anymore. Now it's JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby. They have libraries for everything. It's practical. I ship fast. For my own projects, I still use functional languages occasionally.
